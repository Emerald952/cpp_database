## Acknowledgements & Credits

This project is heavily inspired by [AdamFowlerUK](https://github.com/adamfowleruk) and his [GroundUpDB](https://github.com/adamfowleruk/groundupdb) series.

The structure, database logic, and concepts are based on following his excellent tutorial series on building a database from scratch in C++.

This project was built for learning purposes and expanding my understanding of C++ systems programming, databases, and command-line tool development.
